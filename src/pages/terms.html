    <h1>Terms</h1>

    <h2>Basic Commands</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><code>cd</code> - change directory</li>
      <li><code>ls</code> - list directory</li>
      <li><code>mkdir</code> - make directory</li>
      <li><code>cp</code> - copy file or directory</li>
      <li><code>mv</code> - move file or directory</li>
      <li><code>rm</code></li>
      <li><code>pwd</code> - print working directory</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Git</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Git</dt>
      <dd>Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.</dd>

      <dt>Clone</dt>
      <dd>A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.</dd>

      <dt>Forking</dt>
      <dd>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.</dd>

      <dt>Branch</dt>
      <dd>A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.</dd>

      <dt>Push</dt>
      <dd>Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them</dd>

      <dt>Pull</dt>
      <dd>Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.</dd>

      <dt>Merge</dt>
      <dd>Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.</dd>

      <dt>Commit</dt>
      <dd>A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</dd>

      <dt>SSH Key</dt>
      <dd>SSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information from GitHub.com to your computer.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Github</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Repository (Repo)</dt>
      <dd>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</dd>

      <dt>Issues</dt>
      <dd>Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.</dd>


      <dt>Pull Requests</dt>
      <dd>Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.</dd>
    </dl>
